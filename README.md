# Visualizing Netflix Data with Amazon QuickSight

## Introduction

In this project, I used **Amazon QuickSight** to visualize Netflix data. In this project I created interactive dashboards, visualized data, and generated business insights in real-time.

**Amazon QuickSight** is a fully managed, scalable and cost-effective cloud-based Business Intelligence (BI) service that enables users to:
- Build interactive dashboards.
- Gain actionable insights from data.
- Scale seamlessly with enterprise-level capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
1. Uploading a dataset to **Amazon S3**.
2. Connecting the dataset to **Amazon QuickSight**.
3. Creating visualizations and applying filters.
4. Designing a dashboard to present the final insights.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, I needed:
- An **AWS account** with access to Amazon S3 and QuickSight.
- A dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`) for analysis.
- Basic familiarity with cloud services and data visualization.

---

## Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. Upload Dataset Files to Amazon S3
I started by uploading the following files into an **S3 bucket**:
- `netflix_titles.csv`
- `manifest.json`

Next, I edited the `manifest.json` file to include the **S3 URI** for the `netflix_titles.csv` file. This step is essential because QuickSight uses the `manifest.json` file to locate and read the dataset.

### 2. Create a QuickSight Account
I created a **QuickSight account** using the **30-day free trial**. The account creation process was straightforward and took about **3-5 minutes**.

---

### 3. Connect the Dataset to QuickSight
1. I navigated to the **Datasets** panel on the QuickSight home page and clicked **New Dataset**.
2. I selected **S3** as the data source and connected it using the **S3 URI** from the `manifest.json` file.

ðŸ’¡ The `manifest.json` file was critical because it provided QuickSight with the location and structure of my dataset.

---

### 4. Create Visualizations
After uploading the dataset, I created my first visualizations. Hereâ€™s what I did:
- **Top 20 Records by Release Year and Type**:
  - Dragged `release_year` into the **Y-axis** of a **Donut Chart**.
  - Dragged `release_year` into the **Y-axis** and `type` into the **group/color field** of a **Vertical Bar Graph**.

---

### 5. Apply Filters
I used filters to refine the data and focus on specific insights. For instance:
- I created a filter for `release_year` to display records from **2015 and later**.
- I visualized genres like **Action & Adventure**, **TV Comedies**, and **Thrillers**.

---

### 6. Designing a Dashboard
To present the insights, I designed a dashboard with the following steps:
1. Labeled each graph clearly.
2. Aligned all visualizations for a clean and professional look.
3. Exported the dashboard as a **PDF** by clicking **Export** in the top-right corner and selecting **Generate PDF**.
